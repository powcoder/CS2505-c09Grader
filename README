README for C08 in CS 2505 Spring 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tarball you just extracted should contain three files:

   README               this file
   gradec09.sh          grading script we will use to test your submission
   c09Files.tar         tar file containing test files:
      c09driver.c	      test driver (read the comments!)
      Rational.h	      header file for assigned function (do not modify!)
      TestRational.h	   header file for testing/grading code (do not modify!)
      TestRational.o	   64-bit implementation of the testing/grading code

We suggest you do your development work in a different directory than where you
unpacked this tar file.  Create a develpement directory and unpack c09Files.tar
into that directory (leave a copy in the same directory as gradec09.sh).

Create Rational.c (you can just copy the function declarations from Rational.h).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the test files in your development work:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile with the command:

   gcc -o c09 -std=c11 -Wall -W -ggdb3 c09driver.c Rational.c TestRational.o

Note:  you will get lots of warning messages about things like unused parameters
       until you have implemented the functions in Rational.c

Run c09; see the header comment in c09driver.c for execution options.

Examine the various log files created by c09 to see how you're doing.  Barring
a runtime crash, a score will be shown at the end of each log file.

By default, c09driver.c will run tests for ALL functions.  There is a separate
block of code in c09driver.c for performing each test.  Each of those code
blocks is bracked by a #ifdef/#endif construct; if you comment out certain lines
near the beginning of c09driver.c, you can disable the tests you do not want to
run.  See the comments in c09driver.c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the grading script to verify your final submission:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the grading script, copy your Rational.c file into the directory with
gradec09.sh.  We recommend naming your source file using your PID; e.g., wmcquain.c.

Execution options for the grading script:

   gradec09.sh <name of your source file>
      Create a build directory
      Copies your source file into ./build and renames it Rational.c
      Unpacks c09Files.tar into ./build
      Tries to build an executable in ./build
      Runs the executable to perform testing
      Writes a summary of the testing to PID.txt
      
   gradec09.sh -clean
      Deletes all the files created by a previous run of the gradec02.sh
